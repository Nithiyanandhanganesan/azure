Regions and Zones:
=================

- Region is specific geographical location to host your resources.
- We can have multiple regions for high latency.
- Eg: We can one "Region" in central america, and one in east and one it west.
- In each region, we can have multiple data center which is called as "Zones"
- Each Zones has independent power , networking & connectivity.
- Zones in a regions are connected through low-latency links.


Azure Virtual Machines:
=======================

- Virtual servers in Azure
- Features:
    - create and manage lifecyle of VM
    - load balancing and auto scaling.
    - attach storage to your VM
    - Manage network connectivity and configuration.

Image     - Operating System and software
VM Family - family of hardware (general purposed, compute/ storage optimized, GPU, HPC)
VM Size   - Inside each VM family variety of hardware configuration available.
Disks     - By default disk attached to the VM which has OS

Increase Availability for VM:
  - Single Instance VM:
       - Premium SSD or Ultra Disk : 99.9%
       - Standard SSD 99.5%
       - Standard HDD 95%

  - Two or more instance in same Availability Set(logical group of VM) : 99.95%

  - Two or more instance in two or more AZ in the same Azure region : 99.99%

Availability Set:
   - Logical Grouping of VM
   - Fault Domains : Group of VMs sharing a common power source and network switch.
   - Update Domains: Group of VMs that are rebooted at the same time.




Create New VM:

    - In Azure portal , search Virtual Machine.
    - Select subscription.
    - Resource group will be group of resource such as database, queue, VM.
       For same project , use smae resource group.
    - Select VM size.
    - Select Http and ssh for inbound network port
    - Click create


Login to VM:

  chmod 400 my-first-vm_key.pem
  ssh -i my-first-vm_key.pem azureuser@20.213.185.159

Install software in VM:
  sudo su
  apt-get -y update
  apt-get -y install nginx
  Open Browser and type 20.213.185.159:80


  echo "Hello World" > /var/www/html/index.html
  Open Browser and type 20.213.185.159:80
